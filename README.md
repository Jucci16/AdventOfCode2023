# Advent of Code 2023 - C# Solutions

## Description

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 challenges, implemented in C#.

Advent of Code is an annual coding event with daily programming challenges throughout the month of December. Each day presents a new set of problems that test algorithmic and problem-solving skills.

Feel free to explore the solutions, learn from the code, and use them as a reference. If you have any suggestions or improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Getting Started 

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

 - Visual Studio or any C# development environment.

### Clone the Repository

```

## Usage

Each Day's solution is organized in its own class, named 'Day1', 'Day2', and so on. Each of these classes can be run from the 'Program.cs' file.

To run a specific day's solution, open the solution file, uncomment the day, and use ```dotnet run``` command.
